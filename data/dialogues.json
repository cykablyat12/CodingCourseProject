    "It's the year 2070. Recent breakthroughs in space technology have made it more common to use robots for space missions. Robots can be exposed to hazardous environment, and their batteries can be recharged via solar panels, meaning that more, potentially dangerous planets can be explored at a lower cost.",
    "Mark, an astronaut robot, is travelling through space in search for life outside planet Earth. Things have been quite good so far, ...",
    "...when suddenly, an asteroid flies past, colliding with his spaceship. The collision destroyed the rear compartment of the ship, forcing him to perform a crash landing.",
    "Fortunately, Mark managed to land on a nearby planet. Now, he's seeking for help to repair his severely damaged spacecraft.",
    "After a while, Mark found a vehicle rescuer named Roger."
